• Quick feedback on cdp:

  - Port confusion: cdp tabs list defaulted to 2102; I initially tried 9222. A hint in cdp connect about matching tabs list host/port would help.
  - eval returns "object" when I accidentally returned a DOM node; maybe warn or stringify? A helper like cdp eval --json that auto-serializes plain objects would be great.
  - Page load timing: I had to manually sleep/retry. A --wait flag or cdp wait --selector would make flows smoother.
  - UI automation: basic helpers like cdp click <selector> / cdp type <selector> / cdp wait-visible <selector> would reduce custom JS.
  - Tab targeting: cdp connect by URL was good once I used the right port; an option to connect by tab index (from tabs list) would be nice.

  Overall it worked, but I leaned on custom JS and extra scripts to locate elements.
