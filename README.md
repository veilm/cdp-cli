# cdp-cli

A tiny Chrome DevTools Protocol helper for poking at live tabs (DOM snapshots, styles, screenshots, console streaming, etc.).

```
sudo ./install.sh
cdp --help
```

Use `cdp --help` (or `cdp <command> --help`) for switches and examples.

would probably be fine for my use case tbh but I just personally prefer only
